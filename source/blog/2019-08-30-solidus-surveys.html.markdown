### Hello everyone!

As we have already announced in our Slack channel, we are currently conducting two surveys that will
help us define Solidus' roadmap for the rest of 2019 and 2020.

The first survey is aimed at websites which are currently on Solidus: we think you, the Solidus
community, can provide invaluable feedback on what's working and what we could be doing better for
you. The second survey is for websites which are currently on a different platform. It will help us
understand how we can make Solidus a more appealing option for these users, and what the biggest
and most recurring pain points are in the eCommerce space.

**You can find the surveys here:**

We're trying to reach as many people as possible and we would really appreciate your help! Fill the
surveys if you haven't already (they're very short!), and share them with your network if you think
they have interesting thoughts or ideas to send our way.

**Together, we are going to shape the future of Solidus!**
