Hello, Solidus Community! For those of you who missed it, our new [Partners page](/partners) is out along with the related Partner Program!

If you're interested in becoming a partner that will be listed on the page and have the opportunity to get in touch with promising clients, you need to: 

1. Make a monthly recurring donation via [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/solidus).
2. Fill out [this form](https://solidus-ecommerce.typeform.com/to/D7tUGo).

The Solidus partnership program is your chance to present yourself as a Solidus expert and show your commitment to the project.

You can find more info about the possible tiers on the [Partners page](/partners).

If you need any clarification, feel free to [contact us](/contact)!
