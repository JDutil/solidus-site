#### Extensions Are Dead, Long Live Extensions!

The talk goes into depth about the problems we are currently facing in the Solidus extensions ecosystem and how we have decided to approach them. Alessandro will talk about streamlining and automating extension maintenance with the right tools, getting rid of monkey-patching by going back to the basics of OOP, and enforcing a clear governance model that creates accountability for maintainers and the core team.
