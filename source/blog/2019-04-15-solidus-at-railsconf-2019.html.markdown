##Meet Us At RailsConf!

Are you going to <a href="https://railsconf.com/">RailsConf 2019</a> in Minneapolis? So are we! We’ve scheduled a `Birds of a Feather` session for Solidus users at RailsConf - if you’d like to meet some of the people who use, work on, and love Solidus, you should stop by and say hello. This will be an excellent opportunity to get together and talk about the future of E-Commerce on Rails. See you there.

Don't forget to <a href="https://twitter.com/SolidusIO">follow us on Twitter</a> for up-to-date information about the RailsConf meetup - and all future events.
