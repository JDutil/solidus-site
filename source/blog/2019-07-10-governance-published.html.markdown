There's a lot of history behind Solidus, and long-time users already have a
good understanding of who is behind and cares for the platform and its future.

We know this is not enough: we want to empower developers and businesses with
all the information they need to evaluate Solidus as the foundation for their
store. That's why we have just published a document explaining our governance
model.

The power of Solidus lies in the diversity of its community and the passion
they put into improving the software. These individuals and companies are the
ones that design the future of Solidus every day. They are freelancers,
consultancies, retailers, open-source enthusiasts or simply aficionados. They
have different skills, interests and responsibilities.

Without further ado, let’s see all the players in the Solidus game!


### Project Director

At present, [Nebulab](https://www.nebulab.it) is the main code contributor and
director of Solidus.

They provide technical guidance and coordinate community efforts and activities.

### Core Team

The Core Team is a group of individuals who are committed to maintaining the
project from a technical perspective for the long term. Their main goal is to
continuously deliver value to the community through their work and the work of
all contributors.

Here are some of the tasks they are responsible for:

- implementing new features;
- identifying and fixing bugs;
- triaging issues;
- reviewing and merging pull requests;
- providing support via Slack and other channels;
- improving the documentation;
- providing technical feedback and guidance to contributors;
- coordinating the work of contributors;
- maintaining the code, documentation, and tools.

### Donors

Like many open source projects, Solidus lives thanks to the donations of our
amazing community.

In order to be completely transparent towards the community, we chose Open
Collective as our platform for collecting and spending donations. This helps
us keep the project running while at the same time keeping you informed on
the latest developments and how your money is being spent.

If you're an agency, being a donor also entitles you to become a Solidus
partner. If you're interested, head over to the
[Partners](https://solidus.io/partners/) page on our website to learn more
about partners.

### Stakeholders

Stakeholders are members of the Solidus community who have a strong interest
in the future of Solidus. This group includes retailers, agencies and long-term
friends of the project.

They coordinate and contribute to Solidus usually in non-technical ways, for
instance by choosing what conferences to attend or organize, by identifying
marketing opportunities or by deciding how to use the funds in Open Collective.


## Future-proof governance

This structure is what makes Solidus unique. We love it because it allows us
to hear all the voices in the community when making decisions. In case one
of the entities involved can no longer take care of the project, the
governance structure can be reshaped to guarantee Solidus’ survival.
