As with all open source projects, the heart and soul of Solidus lie in its community. Over the
years, hundreds of people have contributed to Solidus to turn it into the best eCommerce platform
for custom stores, and we are honored for having the opportunity to work with such outstanding
professionals every day.

It is our responsibility to ensure Solidus continues to be an amazing and collaborative space for
developers and eCommerce experts from all over the world, which is why we are proud to present the
first version of our [Community Guidelines](https://solidus.io/community-guidelines).

We want everybody to feel welcome and free to contribute to Solidus and participate in its 
community, no matter their identity or beliefs, and we can only do that by having the proper tools 
and processes in place.

At this time, the Community Committee, responsible for enforcing the Guidelines, is made up by
Jacob Herrington, Peter Berkenbosch and Alessandro Desantis. Feel free to reach out to them on Slack
if you have any questions or feedback!

We hope that the Guidelines will encourage even more people to contribute to Solidus and be a part 
of our community. We look forward to seeing you!
