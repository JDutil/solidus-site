Hey there! We just wanted to update you about the current state of Design in the 
Solidus ecosystem and give you a little preview about its future.

## Rebranded Admin

As you may have already noticed, in version [2.9](https://solidus.io/blog/2019/07/16/solidus-v2-9.html)
we finally updated the color palette of the Admin UI to a brand new one, which 
has already been in use on the solidus.io website for a while. This change comes 
from the aim to consolidate the Solidus brand and stand out from the competition.
Another great new change is using Inter as default typeface on the admin. [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) 
is an Open Font similar to Roboto and Appleâ€™s San Francisco, which was designed 
for user interfaces with focus on high legibility.

## Collapsing Sidebar

This long-overdue feature changed hands in its implementation over these years. 
Finally, thanks to the work of more than one contributor ([#3322](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/3322), [#2961](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/issues/2961), [#666](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/issues/666), [#2957](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/2957), [#1718](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1718)), we can easily 
minimize the admin sidebar navigation and recover some lost screen real estate. 
This is the first step in achieving a more responsive and modern UI in Solidus.

## Solidus Brand
We released a [public repository](https://github.com/solidusio/brand) with all the Solidus brand assets, so if you 
need to use the Solidus logo, please use those official resources. 
We plan to publish those brand assets, along with a revamped style guide, also 
on the official project website. Stay tuned!

## What's next?
The next step is to follow the upcoming official roadmap, making design decisions 
based on a shared purpose and qualitative and quantitative data.
