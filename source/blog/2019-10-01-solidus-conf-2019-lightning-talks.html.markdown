### Introducing SolidusConf Speaker You
------

Weâ€™re proud to announce that *YOU* could be joining us as a speaker for [SolidusConf 2019](http://conf.solidus.io).

You like open source. You probably depend on it - or at least use it a lot - at work. Regardless, it's something that you're passionate about, and you want to spread that passion. Maybe you want to explain how you've tackled a platform problem in a novel way. Maybe you want to share an integration you've done for Solidus. Or maybe you just want to talk about how your team came to the decision to move to Solidus. It doesn't matter - we want to hear from you!


#### Lightning Talks

This speaker spot at [SolidusConf 2019](http://conf.solidus.io) will consist of 5 or 6 speakers, each giving a talk lasting a maximum of 5 minutes. Anyone will be able to register to give a lightning talk at the conference - just ask one of the organizers where to sign up!
