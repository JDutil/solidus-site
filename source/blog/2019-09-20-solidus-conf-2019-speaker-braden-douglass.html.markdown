#### Breaking Up The Band Monolith With EQ

Emotional intelligence is sometimes missing from the software engineering realm. However, how can we as engineers and managers utilize it when feeling the pain of a monolithic application design? How do EQ markers equate to when and how a monolith should be deconstructed? The talk will explore the fundamentals of emotional intelligence in an engineering team and how to utilize tools from the 'emotional intelligence tool-belt' to read when a team is ready to deconstruct their monolith.
