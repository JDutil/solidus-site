Weâ€™re proud to announce that Sean Denny will be joining us as a speaker for [SolidusConf 2019](http://conf.solidus.io).

Sean Denny is CIO and lead developer at [TubeDepot](https://tubedepot.com) and serves as secretary for the Solidus Stakeholders group. He got his start in web development at the age of 11, learning HTML to build [a Zelda fansite](https://web.archive.org/web/20010405002630/http://zeldacraziness.tripod.com/). His design skills have improved slightly since then.

After work, Sean spends his time playing guitar, video games, and volunteering for various organizations such as Citizens Climate Education and GiveCamp. He was the organizer for last years [Southeast Solidus](https://southeastsolid.us/), and is the lead organizer for this years [SolidusConf 2019](http://conf.solidus.io).

#### Community Driven Solidus

The management of Solidus has largely been nailed down since the dissolution of Stembolt, but what does this new nonprofit, community-driven structure means for the platform long-term? This talk aims to address that questions - and provide an explanation as to why this will benefit the platform.
