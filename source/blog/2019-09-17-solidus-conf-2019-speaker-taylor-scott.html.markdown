### Introducing SolidusConf Speaker Taylor Scott
------

Weâ€™re proud to announce that Taylor Scott will be joining us as a speaker for [SolidusConf 2019](http://conf.solidus.io).

Taylor Scott is currently a Senior Software Engineer working for [Deseret Book](https://deseretbook.com). His current
role involves working with Elasticsearch to provide logging, metrics, and
front-end search. This also extends to DevOps creating CI pipelines and ensuring
reliable testing and deployment. Last but not least, he works on creating
many features for Deseret Book which integrate with the Solidus platform.

When he's not "on the line" researching new technologies and solutions, he's making the
World <sup>of warcraft</sup> a better place. he's also the very proud parent
of an obese cat named Fred who also happens to be his alarm clock in the morning.


#### Taking Solidus From Development to Production

This talk is focused on deploying a Solidus application to a multi-container environment on Elasticbeanstalk in AWS. The stack is a rails application running beside an nginx web server. This will all be executed through GitLab CI but other CI platforms will be similar.
