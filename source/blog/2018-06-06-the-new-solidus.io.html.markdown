You may have noticed that we rolled out a brand new look and feel to
[Solidus.io](https://solidus.io) last month. We wanted a new site that better
communicates Solidus' strengths as a platform. We hope that you agree that
the new branding is more meaningful than what [the old site][old-solidus-site]
offered.

## Better Messaging

What is the meaning we want to convey? **Solidus enables you to build modern,
full-featured ecommerce stores that scale.** The old Solidus site was written by
developers for developers. We still need to tell developers how Solidus can
benefit them. But we realized that developers need help selling Solidus to
non-developers.

We needed to start showing decision makers how the Solidus platform can benefit
their company. So why not make a site that speaks to both the decision makers
and the developers?

And highlighting the kinds of information that developers already know and
business people might be happy to learn. Solidus is *free*, forever. Developers
love Solidus and actively contribute to it.

But really, most of our time went into making all of the words we use to
describe Solidus clear and to the point:

- Solidus is stable, secure, and scalable. [Its core features go a long
  way](/features).
- We have [a team of experienced developers](/developers) committed to Solidus.
- Solidus is extensible and [extensions are powerful](/extensions).

## Better Docs

In addition to Solidus.io, we've just launched the [Solidus
Guides](https://guides.solidus.io) for developers.

Solidus includes a lot of functionality, and until now there hasn't been a good
way to help developers who are new to Solidus, or new to ecommerce, get a handle
on accessing all of its power. 

![Solidus Guides article](2018-06-06-the-new-solidus.io/solidus-guides.png)

We still have lots of work to do. More documentation is being added regularly,
and in the next phase we'll be adding guides for end users (like your customer
support team!), too.

## New Colors

We picked a new, more muted color palette for the Solidus brand. Right now, both
[Solidus.io](https://solidus.io) and the [Solidus
Guides](http://guides.solidus.io) share this new color palette. We will be
rolling out the new branding to the Solidus admin interface and other Solidus
properties, too.

![New Solidus brand colors](2018-06-06-the-new-solidus.io/new-colors.png)

The new colors communicate professionalism, openness, and stability: values
that we know good business people share with the Solidus platform.

While colors are just a small part of the overall message, we want to look
attractive to both developers and the people making the business decisions.

## What's Next?

Development on Solidus continues, and we're still investing in the Solidus
documentation and community.

Now that we are better equipped to share Solidus with the world, the most
important thing is everything we say about Solidus remains true: Solidus is 
a stable, scalable, extensible ecommerce platform that gives everyone complete
control of their stores.
