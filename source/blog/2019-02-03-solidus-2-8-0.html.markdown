Announcing Solidus 2.8.0

Thanks to all contributors, testers, and users who made this release possible.

### Major Changes

**Added Api::CouponCodesController#destroy endpoint**

A new endpoint has been added to Solidus API. It allows to remove a coupon code
from an order. It has currently no backend or frontend implementation but
it's common for custom stores to require it.

- Add Api::CouponCodesController#destroy endpoint [#3047](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/3047) ([aitbw](https://github.com/aitbw))

**Moved Reports into an extension**

We removed the reports section from admin to an extension. If you use it you
have to add it back manually by adding

    gem 'solidus_reports', github: "solidusio-contrib/solidus_reports"

- Move reports from backend into an extension [#2814](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/2814) ([jtapia](https://github.com/jtapia))

**Add a store credit reasons UI in Admin**

The only way to manage store credit reasons was via console or using a data
migration.

- Add a store credit reasons Admin UI [#2798](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/2798) ([jtapia](https://github.com/jtapia))

**Skip forgery protection in api controllers**

Rails is now enabling forgery protection by default so we need to explicitly
disable it for api requests, as described here:

http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/RequestForgeryProtection.html

This PR also enables forgery protection by default in the specs dummy app so
that we can really test that the api code is working in a real Rails 5.2+
environment.

- Skip forgery protection in api controllers [#2800](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/2800) ([kennyadsl](https://github.com/kennyadsl))

**Add a Gallery to handle variants and products images**

All images that we send to the view layer is now using these classes that
contain the logic to retrieve images and are easier to extend. If you have
a lot of customization on how you display images you probably need to take
a look at how this has been implemented.

- Add `#gallery` to `Variant` and `Product` [#2337](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/2337) ([swcraig](https://github.com/swcraig))

**Replace jquery_ujs with rails-ujs**

This is the Rails standard now. There could be some action required, depending
on if the manifest provided by solidus has been changed. Please read the
PR description for more info.

- Replace jquery_ujs with rails-ujs in frontend and backend [#3027](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/3027) ([kennyadsl](https://github.com/kennyadsl))

**Removed code from Spree::Promotion**

Previously Solidus used `code` column on `spree_promotions` to add a code
to promotions that could be used as coupon code by users. This is no more a
thing since we support multiple coupon codes associated to a single promotion.

This change is important because it's quite common for old stores to have some
promotion with `code` field still present in the database, even if it's not used.
When performing the migration present in this PR it will raise an exception if
there are records in the `spree_promotions` table with that field present.
It's up to each store to understand how to handle this scenario before running
this migration. We also provide other two ways to handle this, and users can
just change the migration after it has been copied into their store.
It's just matter of changing the content of the
`RemoveCodeFromSpreePromotions.promotions_with_code_handler` method and make it
return one of the following:

- `Solidus::Migrations::PromotionWithCodeHandlers::MoveToSpreePromotionCode`:
  it will convert Spree::Promotion#code to a `Spree::PromotionCode` before
  removing the `code` column.
- `Solidus::Migrations::PromotionWithCodeHandlers::DoNothing`: it will print
  a message to track what we are deleting.

Alternatively users can create their own class to handle data and return that
class. The new class could inherit from `PromotionsWithCodeHandler` and
should respond to `call`.

- Remove `code` column from `spree_promotions` table.
