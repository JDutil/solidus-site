### Introducing SolidusConf Speaker Joel Saupe
------

We’re proud to announce that Joel Saupe will be joining us as a speaker for [SolidusConf 2019](http://conf.solidus.io).

Joel is Lead Software Engineer of Frontend Development at [Deseret Book](https://deseretbook.com) and a certified pixel pusher. Otherwise, he's found kickin' it with his family or running for extended periods of time.


#### Solidus API: From PWAs to Native and Beyond

In a world of JavaScript and native apps, how does Solidus fit in? We’ll discuss the highs and lows of using the Solidus API, and how we built an extensible JavaScript SDK enabling us to develop Solidus backed PWAs, native apps, and more.
