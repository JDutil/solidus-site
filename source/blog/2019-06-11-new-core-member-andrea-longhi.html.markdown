Today, weâ€™re delighted to announce a new Solidus core team member: Andrea Longhi ([spaghettic0de](https://github.com/spaghetticode) on Github) from [Nebulab](https://nebulab.it/). Vintage electronics enthusiast, Andrea spends much of his spare time tinkering with old computers from the 70s and 80s and fixing audio amplifier of the same vintage.

He loves contributing by fixing bugs, adding new features, and improving the existing code... his motto is `@code.should be_beatiful`, after all.
